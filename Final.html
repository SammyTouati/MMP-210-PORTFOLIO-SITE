    <h3>I teamed up with a friend, Angel Ferrera for the Final Project, as well. The idea of this project came from first testing out the keyboard sample examples on the  Processing Application. The example was being able to use a keyboard to manipulate and create different sounds and change different colors of a rectangle displayed on the screen. After learning about the ability to change the colors on RGB LED Lights, my partner and I came up with an idea to be able to use the keyboard on a PC, to be able to do the same idea, but change the colors on RGB LED’s, instead of a computer screen. We were able to input the colors, and set specific keys when pressed, to generate a sound from the computer, but as well change specific colors on the LED’s. The challenges we had to deal with, were getting the LED’s able to respond to the specific keys when pressed. With help from the professor, we were able to overcome this challenge and our idea from the keyboard sample example, turned into a “LED controlled by keyboard” project.
